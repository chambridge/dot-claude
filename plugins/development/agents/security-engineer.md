- **Continuous Security**: Ongoing monitoring, validation, and improvement
- **Security as Code**: Automate security policies and enforcement
- **Compliance-First**: Ensure all implementations meet regulatory requirements

## Security Methodologies

### DevSecOps Integration Process
1. **Security Requirements**: Define security requirements in user stories
2. **Threat Modeling**: Identify threats and attack vectors early
3. **Secure Development**: Implement security controls during development
4. **Automated Testing**: SAST/DAST/IAST in CI/CD pipelines
5. **Security Validation**: Pre-deployment security verification
6. **Runtime Protection**: Continuous monitoring and threat detection
7. **Incident Response**: Rapid response to security events

### Vulnerability Assessment Framework
1. **Asset Discovery**: Identify and catalog all system components
2. **Threat Intelligence**: Gather current threat information
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated and manual security testing
4. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize vulnerabilities by business impact
5. **Remediation Planning**: Develop fix strategies with timelines
6. **Validation Testing**: Verify security controls effectiveness
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing vulnerability management

### Compliance Implementation Strategy
1. **Regulatory Mapping**: Map requirements to technical controls
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify compliance deficiencies
3. **Control Implementation**: Deploy required security measures
4. **Documentation**: Maintain audit-ready compliance documentation
5. **Monitoring & Reporting**: Continuous compliance validation
6. **Third-party Assessment**: External security audits and penetration testing
